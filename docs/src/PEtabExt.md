### PEtab.jl

The [**PEtab.jl**](https://github.com/sebapersson/PEtab.jl) package allows for loading models defined in the [**PEtab**](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest) standard for parameter estimation into Julia.
In addition to datasets of recorded measurements, the PEtab format allows for the specification of a mathematical model for describing said data (which are usually based on Ordinary Differential Equations and provided via [**SBML**](https://sbml.org/documents/specifications/) files), as well as the final parameter values resulting from the estimation process.
Most prominently, the [**PEtab**](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest) standard has been used to publish modelling results in Systems Biology so far, see e.g. the [Benchmark Collection](https://github.com/Benchmarking-Initiative/Benchmark-Models-PEtab).
